OUR EVALUATION OF MSFT
MICROSOFT CORP is showing strong Earnings Quality, Cash Flow Quality and
Operating Efficiency, and Valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk, but Balance
Sheet Quality is weak. When combined, MSFT deserves a HOLD rating.
The Balance Sheet rating improved on the strength of better liquidity. Though this
dimension and all of the others were either stronger or unchanged at worst, it was not
sufficient to raise the overall rating.

EARNINGS QUALITY: STRONG
Earnings quality has long been analyzed and used by investors as a measure of the fundamental quality of the company and its
future prospects. Companies may be including certain items that increase reported earnings and often the amount of cash flow
supporting the earnings may be weak.  Jefferson adjusts for these kinds of items and other anomalies to produce an adjusted
earnings number that more accurately reflects ongoing business fundamentals at MICROSOFT CORP. Reported earnings are
compared to the Jefferson adjusted earnings as a means to gauge earnings quality. Also measured is the amount of cash flow that
underpins earnings.
The earnings quality for MSFT remains STRONG.
With an adjusted net income of $5,253M in the last quarter that was greater than the reported number, MSFT's quality of net income
earnings is extremely high. However, operating cash flow decreased during the last quarter to $8,354M from $9,514M, and the ratio
of operating cash flow to earnings has also declined. Though both Earnings Quality measures declined, the changes were not
sufficient to lower the overall rating.

CASH FLOW QUALITY: STRONG
Cash flow is considered by many investors to be the ultimate measure of company performance and more reliable than reported
earnings. The Jefferson measurement eliminates items that are not part of recurring cash flow or the result of actual operations for
MICROSOFT CORP. These adjustments to cash flow provide a truer measure of cash flow and the resultant cash flow quality rating.
The cash flow quality rating for MSFT remains STRONG  Meanwhile the operating cash flow quality year over year weakened.
Even though the quarterly operating cash flow quality improved with a reported number of $8,354M and an adjusted number that
was 129.0% of reported, the decline in the annual operating cash flow quality offset this with a reported number of $32,231M and an
adjusted number that was 85.6% of reported. This represents deterioration from the previous period when the reported number was
closer to the adjusted number.

OPERATING EFFICIENCY: STRONG
The ability of MICROSOFT CORP to earn a profit is in part the result of how rapidly it converts its collection of assets into revenues
and the resulting earnings and cash flow margins available. Operating Efficiency is measured by a combination of factors including:
return on invested capital (ROIC), gross margin, EBIT margin, asset turnover, equity turnover, and lastly Staff, General, and
Administrative costs as a percentage of sales (SGA).
The operating efficiency rating for MSFT remains STRONG as the SGA costs and EBIT margin strengthened over the last quarter,
while at the same time the ROIC, gross margin and net margin weakened.
Even though the SGA costs improved from 39.9% to 34.2% of sales, the decline in ROIC offset this, deteriorating from 21.6%to 20.1%.
The lower ROIC indicates that MSFT is producing less profit per dollar of capital invested in the business.

BALANCE SHEET QUALITY: WEAK
The balance sheet shows the ability of MICROSOFT CORP to pay its bills and fund future growth. It also provides clues to aggressive
accounting since reported earnings that do not generate cash flow generally end up somewhere on the balance sheet. The following
are analyzed in determining balance sheet quality: quick ratio, current ratio, cash position, accounts receivable days sales
outstanding (AR DSOs), and number of days inventory is held prior to sale to customers (Inv Days).
The balance sheet rating for MSFT strengthened from WEAKEST to WEAK as the AR DSOs and cash position improved over the last
quarter.
AR DSOs decreased from 81 to 50 days, indicating that MSFT has shortened the time it takes on average to receive payment from its
customers, thereby increasing liquidity. In addition, the cash position improved from $85,709M to $89,193M. The higher amount of
cash on hand indicates that MSFT will be better able to meet financial obligations.

DEFINITIONS
Adjusted Net Income: Adjusted Net Income is a company’s
reported net income less adjustments for one-time and
non-operating items yielding a more realistic picture of a
company’s ongoing earnings.
Accruals – Forecasted and Actual: The comparison of forecasted
and actual accruals identifies a discretionary build not
attributable to a company’s sales growth, and could be a sign of
poor earnings quality. For our purposes, the forecasted accrual
component is an aggregate measurement of total accruals
(short-term balance sheet accounts) that distinguishes between
“normalized” and “extraordinary” accruals. The normalized
accruals are based on historical relationships between sales and
accruals and are dynamically adjusted over time to account for
changes in the ratio between these two variables. Normally,
short term accruals will grow as sales grow – i.e., the
“normalized” measure. Discretionary accruals are the portion of
accruals that are in excess of the base factor and therefore
exceed the normal and are “extraordinary”.
Adjusted Operating Cash Flow: Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is
reported operating cash flow less adjustments for one-time and
non-operating items yielding a more realistic picture of a
company’s ongoing cash flow from operations.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow: Adjusted Free Cash Flow is reported
operating cash flow less adjustments for one-time,
non-operating items and capital expenditures. This provides a
more realistic picture of a company’s ongoing cash generation
from operations after capital investments.
Flow Ratio: The Flow Ratio is a measurement of management’s
effectiveness in managing its working capital to maximize the
company’s cash flows. The measure is a ratio of a company’s
non-cash current assets to its non-interest bearing short-term
liabilities.– These non-cash assets include items such as
accounts receivable (which are essentially interest-free loans to
customers) and inventory (which is subject to obsolescence or
spoilage). The non-interest bearing liabilities are essentially
interest-free loans to the company. A lower ratio implies tighter
cash management for a company as it has less cash tied up in
non-cash current assets and is able to utilize interest free loans
from suppliers.
Cash Flow Return on Investment: Cash Flow ROI is a measure
of a company’s ability to generate operating cash flow from its
invested capital. Many analysts consider this measure preferable
to an earnings return measure such as ROE since cash flow is
considered a more reliable measure.
Adjusted Cash Flow Return on Investment: Adjusted Cash Flow
ROI is a measure of the ability to generate operating cash flow
from its investment in capital calculated using a company’s
adjusted cash flow.
Debt Coverage: Debt Coverage is a measure of a company’s
ability to cover its debt obligations with cash flow it generated
from continuing operations.
Adjusted Debt Coverage: Adjusted Debt Coverage is a measure
of a company’s ability to cover its debt obligations with cash
flow it generated from continuing operations, calculated using a
company’s adjusted cash flow.
Adjusted Return on Invested Capital: Adjusted ROIC assesses a
company’s efficiency at allocating the capital to profitable
investments using a company’s adjusted net income (see above)
yielding a measure of how well a company is using its capital to
generate returns.
Adjusted EBIT Margin: Adjusted EBIT Margin is a measure of a
company’s earnings before interest and income taxes less
adjustments for one-time and non-operating items divided by a
company’s sales.
Adjusted Net Margin: Adjusted Net Margin is a measure of a
company’s net income less adjustments for one-time and
non-operating items divided by a company’s sales.
Return on Incremental Invested Capital: ROIIC measures the
relationship between incremental investment and incremental
net operating profit after tax. This provides a measure of the
returns a company is earning on recent investments rather than
all investments as measured by ROIC.
Cash Conversion Cycle: The Cash Conversion Cycle measures
the number of days working capital is tied up from the date of
purchase of raw materials until the collection of cash from the
sale of the product.
Debt to Tangible Equity: Debt to Tangible Equity is a ratio of a
company’s debt to equity less adjustments for goodwill and
other intangible assets yielding tangible equity.
Debt to Tangible Assets: Debt to Tangible Assets is a ratio of a
company’s debt to total assets less adjustments for goodwill and
other intangible assets.
Price/Adjusted Earnings: Adjusted Price/Earnings is a relative
valuation measure comparing a company’s share price to its
adjusted net income.
Price/Adjusted Cash Flow: Adjusted Price/Cash Flow is a
relative valuation measure comparing a company’s share price
to its adjusted cash flow.
Price/Adjusted Earnings Growth: Adjusted Price/Earnings
Growth is a relative valuation measure comparing a company’s
share price to its growth in adjusted earnings.

ABOUT THE FINANCIAL SONAR™ REPORT & METHODOLOGY
The Jefferson Financial Sonar™ ratings system classifies companies into three categories: Buy, Hold and Sell. The Financial Sonar
rating is the result of a point scoring system derived from the five main criteria.  The more negative the rating, the more likely the
overall rating will be a Sell. More positive criteria will support an Overall Rating of Buy.
Jefferson Research & Management has developed the Financial Sonar™ Rating System which is based upon five analytical criteria:
Earnings Quality, Cash Flow, Operating Efficiency, Balance Sheet, and Valuation. The first four criteria are rated in one of four
categories (best to worst): Strongest, Strong, Weak, Weakest. Valuation is also rated in one of four categories (best to worst): Least
Risk, Low Risk, Medium Risk, Most Risk.
