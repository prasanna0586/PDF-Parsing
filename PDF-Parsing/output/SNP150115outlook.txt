SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner is a research client of Edison Investment Research 
Limited 
SNP offers solutions that help enterprises to transform their ERP 
(enterprise resource planning) systems. The group’s SNP Transformation 
Backbone (T-B) software platform speeds up the process, reducing 
consultant days and improving quality. The transformation market is large 
and relatively young, and SNP is expanding into the US and broadening its 
expertise across ERP systems. Further, it is expanding across the 
transformation value chain with the proposed acquisition of RSP, a 
specialist German management consultancy. Hence, with momentum 
strong and consultant utilisation close to full, we believe there is excellent 
potential for both revenues and margins to grow faster than expected.

Investment case: Huge transformation opportunities  
SNP’s T-B is the only off-the-shelf software solution that automates the process of 
combining, upgrading, or carving out data from ERP systems. T-B improves the 
transformation quality and is the only solution that has been accredited by both 
E&Y and PwC, which means it can significantly reduce auditing costs. ERP 
landscapes grow more complex over time, partly driven by M&A, and there is an 
ongoing requirement for companies to improve/upgrade their systems. SNP’s focus 
has been on SAP (26% of the ERP software market), but recently it has expanded 
to Oracle (12% market share) through the acquisition of GL Consulting and a key 
focus is to broaden T-B’s capabilities to handle any-to-any transformations.  
Q3 results and forecasts: Guidance maintained 
After a challenging FY13, SNP’s sales and marketing functions were reorganised, 
and 9m14 revenue jumped 41.1% to €22.5m while operating profit recovered to 
€0.6m from a €3.0m loss. Q4 is traditionally the busiest quarter, and SNP has a 
high order backlog and healthy pipeline. Hence, it maintained its guidance of 
c €30m revenue and mid-single-digit EBIT margin. Our forecasts, which do not yet 
include RSP, are for revenue to rise 32% to €31.1m in FY14, and by 13% to €35.2m 
in FY15. We forecast margins to recover to 5.2% in FY14 and to 10.3% in FY15. 
We forecast net cash to rise to €3.8m at end FY14, lifting to €5.8m a year later.  
Valuation: Pace of margin recovery could surprise 
The stock trades on 48.0x our FY14 EPS, falling to 20.8x in FY15, though we note 
margins will still be less than half the FY09 peak on our forecasts. The valuation 
looks attractive given the strong earnings growth prospects and the potential for 
both revenues and margins to rise faster than expected. Our DCF model (WACC of 
12%) values the shares at €15.03, or 7% above the current share price.

Investment summary: Greater emphasis on software 
Company description: ERP transformation experts 
Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, SNP specialises in helping 
businesses tailor and improve their ERP landscapes. The group has two operational segments: 
Professional Services (74% of FY14e revenues), which offers consultancy and training services to 
this effect, and Software (26% of FY14e revenues), which includes the only off-the-shelf 
transformation product in T-B. T-B has been developed on the back of the experience of more than 
2,500 projects, including from GL Consulting, a US business focused on Oracle transformations, 
which was acquired in August 2013. Customers include blue-chip names such as Siemens, 
ThyssenKrupp, E-ON and Porsche. SNP went public in 2000, listed on the General Standard 
segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2003 and the Prime Standard since August 2014. 
Financials: Strong history of growth and profitability 
SNP has a strong track record of delivering growth and profitability, with operating margins reaching 
23.4% in FY09. The group’s flagship software platform, T-B, was launched in August 2009. 
However, margins fell back, due to the expiration of an agreement with SAP in 2012, increased 
investment in the group’s internationalisation strategy and slower than expected growth in T-B, 
which also led to low consultancy utilisation rates. SAP had been licensing SNP Data Distillery (now 
DPM), and this represented the bulk of SNP’s software sales up to FY12. The group’s sales and 
marketing departments were restructured in FY13 and the management team has been refreshed 
with a new CFO and a COO role. The focus now is to boost revenues, both organically and through 
acquisitions. The main organic strategies are to drive high-margin software sales, both directly and 
via a partner network, and develop the any-to-any strategy.  
Exhibit 1: Operating profit and margin trends

Sensitivities: High exposure to SAP products 
Cost-reduction measures and investment freezes for IT projects by customers can lead to project 
delays and/or cancellations. Nevertheless, we note the resilience of the business in the years 
following the financial crisis, which partly reflects the ongoing requirement for transformation 
projects regardless of the economic backdrop. The success of SNP products and services has 
been linked to the success of SAP, though SNP is broadening its offerings to cover Oracle solutions 
and others. Software sales cycle can be long and lumpy. The loss of key personnel is a significant 
risk. Competition for skilled IT professionals could lead to shortages, as is currently the case. 
Revenues Operating profit margin

Valuation: Attractive DCF valuation on conservative inputs 
The stock trades on 48.0x our FY14 EPS, falling to 20.8x in FY15 and to 14.6x in FY16. However, 
the drive to push high-margin software suggests operating margins could potentially rise to 20%+ in 
the medium term (our FY16 margin forecast is 13.5%). Also, we note the group has a strong 
balance sheet with a net cash position. Our DCF model (which assumes a conservative WACC of 
12% and a long-term margin of 18.4%) values the shares at €15.03, or 7% above the current share 
price, while our DCF scenario analysis (see Exhibit 8) suggests significant upside potential. 
Company description: ERP transformation experts  
SNP helps enterprises to tailor and optimise their ERP systems, through its proprietary software 
products and related consultancy services and training. T-B, which is coded in SAP’s ABAP 
language, is the world’s first software solution that automatically analyses changes in ERP systems 
and implements transformations in a standardised way. M&A activity is a driver, as ERP systems of 
acquired businesses will typically be integrated with the acquirer’s IT system, while data of 
disposed businesses need to be “carved out”. As ERP systems are highly complex with each 
installation customised for the user’s specific requirements, it is a highly complex process to 
combine or carve out these systems. SNP has focused on SAP transformations (SAP dominates 
ERP systems in Europe), while the acquisition of US-based GL extends the group’s expertise to 
Oracle transformations. We note that GL’s revenues exceeded $5m in FY12. Further, having 
licenced SAP Data Services (a software tool for moving and managing data) for incorporation into 
T-B, SNP can now offer any-to-any capabilities to a degree. The main business model is a project 
licence, where the T-B software is sold specifically for the project along with consultant man days. 
SNP also sells perpetual licences, along with 18% ongoing maintenance revenues, and the 
customer can operate the software themselves (SNP has a training academy), or SNP can sell 
projects on top. 
Strategy 
The plan is to develop T-B into an industry standard, with the ability to handle any-to-any 
transformations. The development roadmap’s initial plans are to build Oracle to SAP 
transformations directly into T-B, which will significantly improve the efficiency of Oracle to SAP 
transformations. This will involve a middleware solution running between T-B and the group’s 
Oracle product, which was acquired with GL, and the development of predefined routines. One 
interesting aspect is that SAP itself is precluded from undertaking Oracle to SAP transformations 
following the Tomorrow Now legal case. Other iterations (eg, SAP to Oracle, or involving other ERP 
systems) will be added in due course. SNP is planning to expand into strategic consulting (eg, 
advising customers on the process of defining transformation projects) where day rates are typically 
20% higher than standard consulting work. The group also plans to further expand its sales force.  
SNP has traditionally focused on the “DACH” German speaking region in Europe, which generated 
86.4% of FY13 revenues, down from 92.4% in FY12 and 100% in FY06. The group has focused on 
SAP-to-SAP transformations, as c 80% of big companies in Europe use SAP systems. SNP is now 
seeking to expand geographically more aggressively, to take advantage of the growing global 
transformation market. SNP acquired GL Consulting in August 2013, for c $5m including a c $2m 
earnout, which remains on the balance sheet at a reduced amount of c €1.1m. GL offers consulting 
services and a software-based approach to Oracle ERP transformations. Management is on the 
lookout for other selective acquisitions that add to the product offerings, tap new markets or gain 
technical expertise. The GL acquisition is important for the following reasons:  
 It accelerates the group’s entry in the US through an established company. 
 There are cost synergies by merging with SNP America. 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 4 
 It strengthens the strategy for US and Asia, as Oracle is strongly represented there. 
 It is a key part of the group’s any-to-any strategy. 
GL has developed software enabling its consultants to conduct transformations for Oracle 
applications. The Java-based transformation tool supports all common transformation scenarios 
such as splits, mergers and harmonisations. It works at database level and can master simple to 
complex mapping. In the same way as with T-B, the predefined content – ie the contained 
knowledge of the internal structures of the Oracle systems – is an important component of the 
software. The software is currently being integrated into T-B, by utilising middleware.  
We note that in the US and Asia, it is unusual to encounter pure SAP installations while Oracle or 
another application is often the leading ERP system. As such, the ability to conduct transformations 
for and between these applications in any direction is extremely important for ensuring successful 
growth in these markets and will open up a substantial market potential for SNP. 
Intention to acquire RSP Reinhard Salaske & Partner Management Consultants GmbH 
In mid-December, SNP announced that it is seeking to acquire RSP Reinhard Salaske & Partner 
Management Consultants (RSP). The proposed acquisition reflects management’s stated desire to 
expand into high-level management consulting. 
The acquisition is subject to the conclusion of a final purchase agreement and various approvals. 
Details relating to the proposed purchase price have not been disclosed, although SNP has said 
the transaction will be financed largely by debt. The transaction is expected to complete in January 
2015. We will include the acquisition in our forecasts after the deal has completed.  
Headquartered in Wiehl near Cologne, Germany, RSP is an IT service provider and management 
consultancy firm. It advises and supports companies with SAP introduction projects and on 
optimising their business processes through the use of suitable IT systems and applications. In 
addition to SAP, RSP’s service and consultancy scope also covers the technology and software 
platforms QlikView, Java, Microsoft and Sybase. RSP operates predominately in Germany and 
services customers across a wide range of sectors. Customers vary in size from large enterprises 
(eg ABB, Daimler, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens) through to Mittelstand companies. In the year to 
December 2014, RSP is expected to generate revenues of more than €11m. RSP has c 70 
employees and also actively uses freelancers. 
The acquisition of RSP would expand the group’s range of strategy- and process-related 
consultancy services, while also significantly extending its value chain in the corporate 
transformation market.  
New OEM partnership with SAP 
In late December 2014, SNP announced a new commercial agreement with SAP whereby SNP is 
now licencing SAP’s transformation product, SAP Landscape Transformation (SAP LT). SNP is now 
able to offer T-B with SAP LT. SNP T-B already significantly extends SAP LT functionality for SAP to 
SAP transformations. Furthermore, the move helps SNP to pursue its long-term plan to focus on 
enabling customers to migrate from any ERP-system. SNP says that more details will be provided 
with the further development of the partnership with SAP.  
Group structure  
SNP’s headquarters are in Heidelberg, which includes the group’s R&D activities, and, interestingly, 
is a short distance from SAP’s HQ in Walldorf. As at 30 September 2014, the group had 261 
employees, including 37 in software development, 139 consultants and 22 sales people. SNP’s 
consulting legal entity is in Thale, central Germany, where c 60 consultants are based. There are 
c 30 employees in Austria, c 25 in the US and a salesperson in each of Switzerland and South 
Africa. There are four people based in a Spanish near-shore facility that was established in early 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 5 
2014 and SNP plans to increase the Spanish headcount significantly. The Spanish consultants are 
lower cost, speak English and also are useful in dealing with Central/South American customers. 
Recruiting experienced consultants in the German market is currently challenging, and SNP has 
opened a new training centre in Magdeburg, Eastern Germany, to help to alleviate the shortage. It 
currently has 10 trainees on this programme.  
SNP has historically operated as a SAP consulting company. However, it began to develop 
specialist software solutions around the experience gained by its consultants in the field and has 
been evolving to look more like a traditional software business, ie, with its own proprietary software 
and a related professional services unit. The group has two reporting segments: Professional 
Services (74% of FY14e revenues), which still generates the bulk of group revenues through 
consultancy services, along with some modest revenues from training services, and Software (26% 
of FY14e revenues), which includes the only off-the-shelf transformation product in T-B. 
SNP Transformation Backbone (T-B) is the group’s flagship product and generates c 70% of 
software revenues. SNP Data Provisioning & Masking (DPM) (c 20% of software revenues) helps 
companies to reduce development and transformation processes significantly by creating more 
cost-effective test and training scenarios. It is a component of T-B and is also sold as a separate 
module. SNP Dragoman (c 10% of software revenues) is a translation tool that automates and 
simplifies the translation process, and is particularly useful for international projects where a large 
number of texts need to be transferred into other languages. SNP Business Process Analysis 
(BPA) is a new java-based visualisation tool that analyses, documents and compares business 
processes in SAP software. BPA is expected to be extended to other ERP software. 
Training services: Courses are offered to customers (especially those that are sensitive about 
data and prefer to run the software themselves) and partners (so they can run the software for their 
own customers). The training can be carried out at the in-house SNP Academy in Heidelberg or at 
customers’ premises. Courses cover SNP Transformation Backbone, SNP Business Landscape 
Transformation, SNP Business Landscape Management, SNP Dragoman and also SAP Solution 
Manager.  
Routes to market 
SNP currently has 22 sales people, one in pre-sales and 10 in marketing. The sales process 
typically targets the IT department or CFO. The Dragoman translation product is a simple product 
with short sales cycles, sold via telesales, and helps to find higher-value transformation 
opportunities. The new BPA analytics product is also intended to drive transformation opportunities. 
SNP attends a number of industry events and in October 2014, SNP held its first significant 
customer conference, which c 80 customers attended.  
In addition to its own sales team, SNP works closely with independent partners in marketing its 
services and product portfolio. Following the launch of T-B in 2009, it initiated a partner and 
licensing programme, which has since been continuously expanded and developed, and the group 
currently has more than 40 partners (18% of FY13 revenues), which include several large 
enterprises (eg Accenture, Hewlett-Packard and IBM) as well as a range of small players. Through 
its partners SNP aims to expand its core business both domestically and internationally, especially 
in regions where the group has no sales infrastructure, such as in the Nordic region and the UK.  
What is ERP transformation? 
Growing companies accumulate ERP systems through acquisitions and expansion into new regions 
and business lines, and, over time, large corporations can find themselves burdened with some 15 
to 20 ERP systems or even more. Hence, ERP landscapes can eventually become unmanageable 
and the nature of ERP projects from a consulting perspective naturally shifts from implementing 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 6 
new systems to landscape transformations. Transformation projects are among the most critical, 
complex and expensive programs that affect an organisation and its business processes. 
Transformations can be driven by business factors (mergers/acquisitions, disposals or 
restructurings) or technology (consolidation, upgrades/platform migration or data harmonisation).  
SNP Transformation Backbone (T-B) 
T-B takes the user right through the transformation process. A typical T-B project begins with SNP 
Systems Scan, which enables a systematic analysis of company structures to help to tailor the 
project. The next stage involves SNP Analysis, which analyses, compares and interprets the 
business processes, key configuration and components in order to plan the transformation. SNP 
Cockpits comes in at the design phase, guiding the user through the project. Finally, SNP Execution 
provides a speedy, automated, controlled and transparent generation and execution of the 
transformation program.  
Exhibit 2: A transformation project using SNP Transformation Backbone 
Source: SNP 
Predefined routines are available for a number of common scenarios such as system consolidation 
(mergers/acquisitions), carve outs (disposals), chart of accounts restructuring (data harmonisation), 
legacy migration (can require Dragoman for translation) and platform migration (ERP upgrade, can 
require Data Provisioning & Masking for scenario analysis). 
A conventional or classic transformation 
A classic transformation project will involve a large amount of manual processes and tailored 
programming and is typically based around MS Excel and MS Project. Consequently it will be less 
flexible and transparent than the standardised SNP software-based solution and with a greater risk 
of missing deadlines. While operational data (master data, open items and balances) are 
preserved, data history is typically lost. The classic approach can make use of tools that have been 
developed on previous projects or are available in the market such as SAP Data Services. 
Nevertheless, the approach typically requires significantly more consultant man days and time on 
tool development, while the software usage is much lower, and hence the project will take much 
longer and there is a greater risk of human error. 
Key advantages of the SNP Transformation Backbone software 
 It speeds up projects. Eg, a team working on a “carve out” could complete a T-B-based project 
in two to four months rather than the three to six months it would take to do manually. 
 It reduces cost by reducing consultant man days. 
 It improves the quality of the transformation, so much so that SNP Transformation Backbone is 
the only software that is certified by both EY and PwC. This means that in using the software, 
companies can significantly reduce their auditing costs. SNP software is certified according to 
IDW (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) standards. 
 It preserves the data history (manual projects typically do not).  
 It minimises business disruption.  
The precise benefits depend on the type of project; there is high variability. 
The enterprise resource planning (ERP) software market 
ERP software provides an end-to-end information management solution for an enterprise, and can 
be used by all departments to manage the information. Solutions are typically modular, so that 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 7 
enterprises can purchase only the specific modules they require. Each ERP installation is normally 
highly customised, fundamentally unique, and hence any transformation project will be complex.  
The worldwide ERP software market grew 3.8% to $25.4bn in 2013 (Gartner), from $24.4bn in 
2012. SAP retained its market leadership position, selling $6.1bn in ERP software in 2013, up from 
$6bn in 2012. Oracle (includes PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and Fusion brands) was second with 
$3.2bn in sales, down 0.2% from 2012. The shift to the cloud is a major trend, with 2% of 
respondents from a global survey conducted by Gartner already using cloud ERP software and a 
further 47% of organisations surveyed planning to move their core ERP systems to the cloud within 
five years. This trend should drive further demand for ERP transformations and consultancy 
services. However, shifting to the cloud is also likely to reduce the need for such heavy 
customisation. We also note that many enterprises might prefer to keep mission critical functions off 
the cloud, within their firewalls, or perhaps in the private cloud. 
Exhibit 3: ERP software market shares  
Source: Gartner 
M&A: M&A activity is clearly an important driver in ERP transformation, though we note there are 
other factors that can complicate an enterprise’s ERP landscape, such as organic expansion into 
new regions and business lines, while corporate restructurings and spinoffs can be common in any 
economic backdrop. Exhibit 4 shows that global M&A activity in the first nine months of 2014 was 
similar to 2006 levels on an annualised basis.

Competitive environment 
SNP competes with a range of businesses, which we put in the following three categories: 
1. SAP has its own unit, System Landscape Optimization Services, with c 300 consultants who 
work on transformation projects. 
Oracle
Sage
Infor
Microsoft
Kronos
Concur (acquired by 
SAP)
Totvs
2%Yonyou
Others
illi
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 8 
2. Large systems integrators, including Accenture, HP and IBM. These companies are also 
partners of SNP. 
3. Small specialist firms. In Germany this includes three quoted companies All for One Steeb, 
KPS and Realtech. MHP, a unit of Porsche, is also a competitor and SNP partner. Some of 
these companies are also partners of SNP.  
In our view, the ongoing development of SNP’s T-B platform, combined with its strong domain 
knowledge of ERP systems gained through more than 2,500 projects, significantly increases 
barriers to entry into the transformation software market. T-B is the only end-to-end tool that we are 
aware of and SNP’s competitors use higher levels of manual processes associated with the classic 
approach or they might well license the T-B platform.  
Financials: Reverting to a strong growth trend 
Business model: Direct and via partners 
The group sells its software both directly and through its partner programme (40+ partners). The 
business is typically H2 weighted, due to software sales in Q4. Typically 46% of revenues are in H1 
and 54% in H2, including 29% in Q4. 
The consultant utilisation rate dipped to c 60% at the low point in 2013, but more recently has been 
close to 100% due to strong demand for T-B and the group’s related professional services. Around 
70% of consultancy work is done remotely. SNP makes use of freelancers when demand is high. 
There are three business models: 
1. Project based, which is the most common. These are typically ad-hoc projects, normally priced 
at €100-200k, of which 20-30% of the project is software. A typical project is three to six months 
and there are no support and maintenance revenues with a project licence. 
2. Perpetual licence plus 18% pa support and maintenance. The customer runs the software. 
Examples are Siemens and EON. The licence depends on how the deal is structured. Some 
customers prefer to run the software, as they are sensitive about their data. 
3. SNP sells the software platform and sells projects on top – project by project – along with 18% 
annual support and maintenance.  
For projects, revenue recognition is based on the percentage of completion method. Two strategic 
objectives are to encourage customers to take a group licence and to accelerate software sales via 
the partner programme; SNP would like its partners to use T-B to transform all their customers. 
Recent fund-raising 
In December 2012, SNP placed 113,270 bearer shares with institutional investors at €45 each (pre-
split), raising €5.1m to provide funds for both organic growth and potential acquisitions. SNP 
subsequently split it shares in 2013, on a three for one basis, ie, two new shares were allotted for 
each existing share. 
Q3 results: Guidance maintained for FY14 
FY13 was a transitional year for the business; 9m14 revenue jumped 41.1% to €22.5m and 
operating profit recovered to €0.6m from a €3.0m loss. Software sales grew by 73% to €5.5m, as T-
B generated €3.4m (9m13: €2.4m), or 62% (9m13: 75%) of total software revenue while DPM 
generated €0.8m (9m13: €0.1m). Professional services revenues rose by 33% to €17.0m, reflecting 
high utilisation rates in the DACH region. The growth across both divisions follows a refocusing on 
the sales pipeline, after the group’s sales and marketing functions were reorganised in 2013. Also, 
two big projects with Siemens were completed in FY12, and significant changes in the sales team 
meant the pipeline slackened and the consultant utilisation rate subsequently fell in FY13. However, 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 9 
SNP has the opposite problem now, with utilisation close to 100% and a strong backlog and 
pipeline.  
At the time of the Q3 results in October, management maintained its FY14 guidance of c €30m 
revenue and an EBIT margin in the mid-single-digit range, and forecast a strong Q4 “on the back of 
the high order backlog and the advanced negotiations on the sale of software licences”. We note 
that Q4 is traditionally the busiest quarter, mainly due to elevated software licence sales.  
In Q2, SNP acquired the remaining 15% shareholding in its Austrian unit for €0.5m. This removes 
the group’s only outstanding non-controlling interest. As at 30 September, the group has €6.4m in 
cash and €2.4m debt, for a net debt position of €4.0m. In addition, there is a c €1.1m earnout 
liability for GL Consulting, implying an adjusted net cash position of €2.9m. 
Forecasts 
We forecast group revenues to rise 32% to €31.1m in FY14, and then by 13% to €35.2m in FY15. 
We forecast margins to recover to 5.2% in FY14, rising to 10.3% in FY15. We forecast net cash to 
rise to €3.8m at end FY14, lifting to €5.8m a year later (or €4.7m when adjusted for the earnout).  
We note that the company effectively unbundles projects in order to report professional services 
and software as separate divisions, and we have done the same in our forecasts. 
We have not yet included the proposed acquisition of RSP in our forecasts, due to the lack of 
information and uncertainties around the deal. We will adjust our forecasts for the acquisition after it 
has completed.  
Professional services revenues/margins. We assume the average number of consultants rises 
by 10 per year over the next few years, while the rate per day edges higher as the group expands 
into higher value consulting. We assume a 90% utilisation rate in FY14 and FY15, easing back to 
85% in the longer term. We assume a 5% contribution margin in FY14, rising to 8% in FY15, and 
10% in the long term. This is conservatively below the historical peak of 13.7% in FY09. We 
assume modest revenues from training, growing at 2% per annum. In all, professional services 
revenues rise by 23% to €23.1m in FY14 (ie, €6.1m in Q4 for 3% growth over Q413).

Software revenues/margins. We assume software revenues (licences and maintenance) jump to 
€8m in FY14, implying €2.5m revenues in Q4 (93% growth over Q413). We assume this grows by 
25% in FY15 and another 10% in FY16. We assume a 35% contribution margin in FY14, rising to 
42.5% in FY15, and 60% in the long term. The rise reflects the benefits from the relatively fixed 
R&D costs (€4.3m in FY13), and would take the margins back to similar levels as in FY10/FY11. 
Central costs. We assume “non-segment-related expenses” of €2.6m in FY14, rising 10% in FY15. 
We assume €0.2m of “other operating income & other taxes”, which relates to a wide range of 
minor factors including insurance, provision reversals and capital gains.  
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 10 
Tax. We assume an effective tax rate of 30% (noting the tax rates of Germany 30%, Austria 25%, 
US 35%), with a cash tax rate of 28%.  
Cash flow and balance sheet. The group had €3.5m net cash as at 31 December 2013. We 
forecast free cash flow of €1.1m in FY14, rising to €2.4m in FY15. We forecast net cash to rise to 
€3.8m at the end of FY14, which is after the acquisition of SNP Austria minorities and the final 
dividend payment, rising to €5.8m a year later. In addition, there is a $1.6m (€1.1m) earnout 
outstanding relating to the GL acquisition.

Sensitivities: High exposure to SAP products 
SNP’s customers are mainly large corporations, often multinationals, and economic cycles have an 
effect on these businesses. Contracts can be lumpy and the 10 biggest customers generated c €8m 
or c 35% revenues in FY13, and the largest customer generated 6.9% of revenues in FY13 (FY12: 
14.7%). Siemens generated €4m revenues in FY12, falling to €1.3m in FY13 as two large projects 
were completed. Nevertheless, we note the resilience of the business in the years following the 
financial crisis, which partly reflects the ongoing requirement for transformation projects regardless 
of the economic backdrop. SNP has a reliance on SAP’s end-market, though SNP seeks to align its 
solutions to the ERP market as a whole. 
We note the following sensitivities: 
 Economic downturn. Cost-reduction measures and investment freezes for IT projects by 
customers can lead to project delays and/or cancellations.  
 Competition. Other providers may offer better or more cost-effective solutions. However, SNP 
counters this risk through the development of new products and the continuous refinement and 
improvement of its existing products. The complexity of SNP products and processes has 
meant that SNP has, thus far, been able to maintain an innovative advantage over its 
competitors with the general possibility of imitation being limited.  
 Technological change. SNP’s performance largely depends on whether it succeeds in 
adjusting its products to changes in the market. Earnings may be adversely affected if 
technologies prove to be dysfunctional, are not well received on the market or are not launched 
on the market at the right time. The growth of ERP solutions in the cloud provides both a threat 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 11 
and an opportunity for the group, as cloud products are typically less customised than 
traditional solutions but they could add to the complexity of ERP landscapes.  
 Project risks. Project implementation in the ERP transformation market often requires a 
considerable deployment of resources by customers. This is subject to a variety of risks, which 
are often beyond customers’ control.  
 SAP dependency. The success of SNP products and consulting services is strongly linked to 
the popularity and market penetration of the standard ERP software of SAP. There is a risk that 
SAP solutions may be supplanted by competing products. However, the risk of a sudden 
collapse in the market base is low, given the high costs and the time needed to install new 
standard business software, 
 Personnel. The loss of key personnel is a significant risk factor. Competition for skilled IT 
professionals could lead to shortages.  
 Acquisition risk. Implementation risk in the acquisition strategy.  
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 12 
Valuation: Software-led growth and margin recovery 
SNP has a strong track record of profitability, growth and cash generation. Margins surpassed 20% 
in 2008 and stayed above 20% for three years. While there was a dip into the red in FY13, as the 
group restructured its sales team, SNP is now back on track, expanding into the US, and its new 
emphasis on software could potentially drive margins back above 20%. If SNP can successfully 
develop T-B into the industry standard, with the ability to handle any-to-any transformations, the 
stock should then command a leadership valuation in our view. 
We highlight the following points on the group’s valuation: 
 Traditional valuation measures. In traditional valuation terms, the stock trades on 48.0x our 
EPS forecasts in FY14, falling to 20.8x in FY15 and to 14.6x in FY16. 
 Peer comparison. The stock trades on 1.4x FY15 revenues (above its peers’ average of 0.6x) 
and 11.5x FY15 EBITDA (above its UK peers’ average of 6.5x). The premium reflects attractive 
growth prospects and the significant potential for margin recovery.

 FCF yield. SNP generated a free cash outflow of €3.4m in FY13, after a €0.8m inflow in FY12 
(which represents a FCF yield of 1.5%) and €3.8m in FY11 (7.4% yield). We forecast FCF to 
rise to c €1.1m in FY14, rising to €2.4m in FY15 and €3.4m in FY16.These numbers translate 
to FCF yields of c 2% in FY14, c 5% in FY15 and c 7% in FY16.  
 Discounted cash flow valuation. Based on our forecasts and an 18.4% long-term margin 
target, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 12%, and a 2% terminal growth rate, our 
DCF model values the shares at €15.03, or 7% above the current price. A 1% rise in the WACC 
would reduce the valuation to €13.54, while a 1% cut in the WACC would lift the valuation to 
€16.86. Discounting back from our forecasts implies that the market is attributing a break-even 
WACC of 12.7% to the stock. Our DCF scenario analysis, below, suggests the stock is 
SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner | 15 January 2015 13 
attractively priced based on our conservative forecasts and WACC, with the risk on upside 
given the strong software growth prospects and potential to beat forecasts.
